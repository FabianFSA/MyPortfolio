    <div id="aboutMeBody">
      I am in my 8th semester of Business Informatics. I am 27 years old and currently live in Offenbach an der Queich.
      <br />
      My first contact with computer science was during my apprenticeship as an electronics technician for devices and
      systems in the German Army (Bundeswehr) as a civil person.
      My first informatic project was an Ohm calculator programmed in HTML. That stayed in my head for years.
      how much fun it was.
      Through the book 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' I became more involved with my own finances. This increased my interest
      in business topics immensely. So my choice was pretty clear <h3>Business Informatics!</h3>
      In my free time, I like to go hiking or tinker with my own website here.
      Maintaining social contacts should not be forgotten.
